# 2DRandomWalk
A random walk in two dimensions is a chain of independent random experiments called a Markov chain.
A point p starts at the origin and moves with probability 1/4 either to the right, the left, up or down. This is repeated to inifity.
The path the point takes is then the random walk. It can be proven that in two dimensions the point is guaranteed to go back to the origin, the experiment just needs to be performed sufficiently often.
That's why the random walk is stopped once the point returns to the origin. The process can however be started again by clicking the start button.
